IN PROGRESS

## Project Overview

Designing an FPV drone using parts given to me by a colleague who recently graduated

## Educational Value Added

Skills involved include wireless radio communications, soldering, and part analysis

## Tasks

- Connect ELRS Receiver
- Obtain an RC Controller compatible with my ELRS Transmitter Module
- Install propellers
- Verify functionality
- Organize wiring
- Fly!

## Design Decisions

Part selection is constrained by what I have available. I would rather search for parts compatible with what I have now as opposed to purchasing brand-new parts and starting from scratch

## Design Misc

<!-- Your Text Here. You may work with your mentor on this later when they are assigned -->

## Steps for Documenting Your Design Process

- Establish an engineering journal
- Document parts purchased/ obtained
- Record resources used to help guide me (This is my first time after all)
- Document construction process and general notes/ tips

## BOM + Component Cost
