## Current Status
IN PROGRESS

## Project Overview

Designing an FPV drone using parts given to me by a colleague who recently graduated

## Educational Value Added

Skills involved include wireless radio communications, soldering, and part analysis

## Tasks

- Connect ELRS Receiver
- Obtain a RC Controller compatible with my ELRS Transmitter Module
- Verify functionality
- Organize wiring
- Fly!

## Design Decisions

Part selection is constrained by what I have available. I would rather search for parts compatible with what I have now as opposed to purchasing brand-new parts and starting from scratch.
